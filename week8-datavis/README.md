# Data Visualization
Python is one of the easiest programming language to work with data and make data visualization. Let's learn the common Python tools to work wtih data, such as [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html), .

## Core Material
- [`matplotlib` basics](/week8-datavis/01_basics_matplotlib.md)
- [Work with data](/week8-datavis/02_work_with_data.md)
- [Interactive plots with `plotly`](/week8-datavis/03_plotly.md)

## Supplemental Material
- [matplotlib plot types](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html)
- [pandas tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)
- [seaborn gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)

## Assignment
Pick a dataset that interests you. It can be the one we use in class, from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/), or you can create your own dataset by observing your surrounding/daily life.

Create data visualization by ask 1 - 3 questions about the dataset that will guide your analysis. Your questions may explore:
- Rankings: What are the top 5/10/20 based on a specific attribute?
- Group Comparisons: How do values vary when items are grouped by category?
- Relationships: Is there a correlation or trend between two attributes?

Document your questions and visualizations. Submit along with your code and README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).
