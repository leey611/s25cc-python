# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
We can not only create and run web applications with Python, but also build desktop interface and applications with it. Let's make some stupid and bad Graphical User Interface (GUI) with [`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

## Assignment
<u>Option 1:</u>
Recreate an user interface layout (functionalities are optional) you encounter frequently, such as your mobile apps layout, a widget, a form, etc.
<u>Option 2:</u>
Come up with a bad UI or UX that doesn't make sense (feel free to expand from in-class examples). Create it with tkinter.
