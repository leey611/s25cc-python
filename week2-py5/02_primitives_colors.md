# 02: Drawing basic shapes ðŸŸ£ðŸŸ¦ðŸ”º
Draw according to the slide (exercise 02):
- A circle in the center of the sketch. Size 50px. Fill color is green
- A rectangle at position x: 50, position y: 100, 100px width, 200px height. Fill color is blue
- A line starts at (300, 100) and ends at (350, 200)
- An ellipse at (300, 250), 100px width, 50px height. Fill color is yellow

## Setting Colors
[reference](https://py5coding.org/reference/summary.html#creating-and-setting-colors)
- [background()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_background.html) - Sets the color for the sketch background, also, paints over any previous drawing.
- [color_mode()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_color_mode.html) - Changes the way py5 interprets color data, using the constants HSB, RGB and the range of the values to be used.
- [fill()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_fill.html) - Sets the color used to fill shapes.
- [no_fill()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_no_fill.html) - Disables filling geometry.
- [no_stroke()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_no_stroke.html) - Disables drawing the stroke (outline).
- [stroke()](https://py5coding.org/reference/sketch_stroke.html) - Sets the color used to draw lines and borders around shapes.
