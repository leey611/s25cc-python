## Assignment
Find an artwork you like, such as a painting, poster, illustration, pattern, or your self-portrait, recreate it with py5. It doesn't need to be 100% same as the original work. Use basic elements and available functions, such as `rect()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, `arc()`, `bezier()`, `fill()`, and `stroke()` to build your composition. 

Experimenting with interactions and randomness is encouraged. For example, any elements being generated differently every time the sketch is run? Does the size or color change based on mouse position or when the mouse clicks?

Save your sketches as images, write a brief description of your creation and submit the link to your documentation/code/README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).
