# Using LLMs
You have probably used LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or other generative AI for generating text, videos, music etc. Let's run open-source models locally using open-source models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).

## Assignment
1. Run a model locally. It can be any open-source models mentioned in our core and supplemental material. Note that running image or video models require GPUs and it could take much time to run if running on CPU, so I recommend try out text-based models, such as translation, summarization, etc.
Document the model and input you try, and the output, or any errors you encounter. Submit along with your code and README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).
2. Final proposal: write a proposal for your final project in a README, include your idea, technologies, etc. Sign up [1 on 1s](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GYux8HWxmM5AtYJhjjfbxbDtBOoZvPyEuz6DHgi07WY/edit?usp=sharing) for next week. Your final can be:
   - a thorough piece of work you made with python and/or plus other media
   - a series of experimental works you made with topics we covered throughout the class
   - a combined project in which you leverage python techniques made with another class
