# Algorave / Live Coding
Algorave or Live Coding is an approach to create sound, music and visuals by writing and manipulating code. Live coding tools in python include [Sardine](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/sardine) and [FoxDot](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot). Let's make some noise with Sardine.

Other common live coding tools used by artists include [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) and [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/).
