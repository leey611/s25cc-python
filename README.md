# Creative Coding: Python, Spring 2025
Over the past two decades, the programming language Python has emerged as a frequent tool of choice for creative technologists, artists, designers, practitioners, and researchers working in a wide variety of disciplines. Python is often applied to domains such as data visualization, IoT, computer vision, robotics, natural language processing, and machine learning. It has become an industry standard platform in all of these areas and more. Python has also been embraced as a highly effective teaching platform for learning to code. Development and community support for Python is massive, and the language can now be effectively used for almost any creative pursuit. This class will provide students with a thorough foundation of Python as a programming platform via a series of initial weekly projects. These exercises will focus on different aspects of coding (input, output, math, conditionals, looping, functions, classes, object-orientation). Students will also learn about the variety of ways this language is being used in the real world, via examples of actual applications and projects. Depending on students' coding experience (and external research or creative practice), they will (later in the semester) have a choice of either applying Python to their existing studio/research projects, or carrying out individual class projects with foci of their choice.
