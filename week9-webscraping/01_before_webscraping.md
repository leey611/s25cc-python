# Things to know before web scraping

## Best practice to keep in mind
- Be respectful. Abusing a website with scraping request can get your IP address blocked
- Check the permission! Some websites provide API for users, so you won't have to scrape it to get their data
- Websites and web pages may update, and each web page can be unique. You may need to update or customize your code to scrape a site
- If a website doesn't provide an API, or the information you want is not available in the API, use VPN to scrape it anonoymously
