# Web Structure and Request
When you open a website in your browser, you're actually loading a bunch of files from a server:

- HTML – the structure and content of the page (headings, text, links)
- CSS – the styling (colors, layout, fonts, animations)
- JavaScript – the interactivity (clicks, sliders, dropdowns, dynamic content)
- Assets – images, videos, fonts, icons, etc.

To see the detailed strcutre of a website, on a web page, right click and press "Inspect" or hit `shift` + `command/ctrl` + `c`

## What is a "Request"?
Every time you visit a webpage, your browser sends a request to a server to ask for the content. This is called an HTTP request.
