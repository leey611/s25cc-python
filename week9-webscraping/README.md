# Web Scraping
We browse websites every day. We copy text, download images, and save information. When thereâ€™s a need to collect that information in bulk or on a regular basis, web scraping offers a way to automate the process. In python, common tools for web scraping include [`Beautiful Soup`](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [`Selenium`](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/)(more advanced)
