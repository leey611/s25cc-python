# Scroll art
Your terminal is not just somewhere you type commands. Your terminal can be a new form of art--scroll art, using loops and print.

## Assignment
Create a scroll art by modifying a piece you like at The Scroll Art Museum. Pick one piece that interests you, read its source code, and play around with it by:

- changing the variables
- editing the characters
- commenting out or removing a block of code and see the change
- modifying the conditionals

The goal of this assigment is to learn to leverage the good of *open-source arts*, and learn to read other people's code. **Reading code is an effective way to learn to code!!** It's also okay to start from the basic ones, and you don't need to understand every detail of the code to be able to create a fun piece. Messing with or breaking the code is encouraged as well.

**You must credit or reference the original artwork you are adapting**

(If you like, you are also welcome to make your own scroll art from scratch or utilize the techniques you learn from the site.)

Take screenshots, images of your output, submit along with your code and README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).

### Advice for making scroll art by Al Sweigart
- Keep it short. Under 50 lines of code.
- Start simple, then iterate
- Many small programs > One big program
