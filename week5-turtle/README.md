# Turtle graphics
Let's create graphics and geometric art with `turtle`, a built-in python module based on the LOGO programming language, designed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon.

## Core Material
- [Turtle basics](/week5-turtle/01_basics.md)
- [Repeating patterns with loops](/week5-turtle/02_loops.md)
- [Interactivity in Turtle](/week5-turtle/03_interaction.md)
- [Turtle official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

## Assignment
Find a layout, pattern, a piece of geometric art, an illustration or an object composed with geometric lines or shapes (for example, a barcode with lines with different thickness plus some random text below it), draw it with `turtle`. Trying out and expanding from the Supplemental Material and advanced resources is welcome too.

Take screenshots, images, or gifs of your output, submit along with your code and README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).
