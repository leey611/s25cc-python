# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
OOP is a programming style that enables you to organize your code and reuse it with `class` and `objects`.

## Classes
[reference](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36) # initialize an object called p1 with the Person class

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
```

## Methods (functions) in a Class
```
class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc() # calling the myfunc() method on the p1 object
```
