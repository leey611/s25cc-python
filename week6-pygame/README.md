# Pygame
Let's learn [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/), a python library for building games, by making a simple shooting game.

## Assignment
<u>Option 1:</u>
Enhance the game by adding features, such as sound effects, a second player, scene background, score text, winning text/ending scene, or timing systems.

<u>Option 2:</u>
Create your own 2D game using the techniques we have learned and the Supplement Material. Your game should have:
- a main character controlled by the player
- elements that the player can interact with using OOP, such as collectables, enemies etc.
- game assets and effects using sound and game art assets
- score or text indicating the status of your game

Take screenshots, images, or gifs of your output. Make sure your game assets are included in your game folder. Submit along with your code and README to Canvas and our [course wiki](https://github.com/leey611/s25cc-python/wiki).
