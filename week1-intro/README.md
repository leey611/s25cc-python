# Introduction
Welcome to the class. Before we start making things, let's make sure we have a proper place to document our creationâ€”using Github.

## Core Material
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- [Github README Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Learn Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)
- [git cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

to check if `git` is installed:
```
git -v
```
to add **all** the changed files to staging:
```
git add -A
```
or 
```
git add .
```
to commit a change with a message:
```
git commit -m [a description of this change]
```
to push your changes to the remote repo
```
git push [alias] [branch]
```
for example:
```
git push origin main
```

## Assignment
Create a Github repo where you will put your assignments, code, and documentation for this class. In this repo, include a `README.md` to:
- describle what this repo is about
- share the resources you are currently using to learn Python (can be but no need to be the ones listed in the syllabus)
- share an image you like, such as a meme, your work etc.
